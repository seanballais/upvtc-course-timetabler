# TODO
# Tasks I must do.

* Generate class conflicts data.
* Create a separate study plan object to store a study plan. This plan will be
  subscribed to by student groups. This, I think, will allow us to easily
  support irregular student groups.
* Add support for consuming GE and electives JSON file.
* Add support for the JSON file that will hold data about which GEs and
  electives will be taken by various subgroups of student groups.
* Add support for irregular students.
* Generate a timetable.
